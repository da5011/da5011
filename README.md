- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @da5011, or David Abadie. I'm currently a Senior at Tulane University studying Chemical Engineering.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics, as well as kinetics and polymers! Of course, I enjoy learning about ways to model these phenomena.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to study more in these fields, as well as good programming languages and methods to model them efficienlty and accurately.
-    [As of now, I've studied some C/C++, FORTRAN, R, Python, VBA, and SQL]
